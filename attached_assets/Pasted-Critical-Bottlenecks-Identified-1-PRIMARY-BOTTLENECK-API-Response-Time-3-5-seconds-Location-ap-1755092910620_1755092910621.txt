Critical Bottlenecks Identified
1. PRIMARY BOTTLENECK: API Response Time (3.5 seconds)
Location: /api/student/profile/[id] endpoint
Duration: 3,497.5ms (3.5 seconds)
Impact: 69% of total load time
Issue: The main student profile API call is extremely slow
2. SECONDARY BOTTLENECK: JSON Parsing (1.4 seconds)
Duration: 1,416.2ms (1.4 seconds)
Impact: 28% of total load time
Issue: Parsing the API response takes an unusually long time, indicating either:
Very large response payload
Complex nested data structures
Browser performance issues
3. Multiple Component Re-renders
Issue: Duplicate component mounting and data transformation events
Evidence: Same events logged multiple times with identical timestamps
Impact: Unnecessary processing overhead

🎯 Root Causes Analysis
API Performance Issues:
Database Query Complexity: The Prisma query in the API includes multiple nested relations
N+1 Query Problem: Likely fetching related data inefficiently
Missing Database Indexes: Queries on user relationships may lack proper indexing
Over-fetching: API returns more data than needed for initial render
JSON Parsing Issues:
Large Payload Size: Response contains extensive nested objects
Complex Data Structure: Multiple arrays and deeply nested relationships
Browser Memory Pressure: Large objects causing parsing delays
Client-Side Issues:
Duplicate Effect Triggers: React useEffect running multiple times
Unnecessary Re-renders: Component mounting happening twice
Synchronous Processing: Data transformation blocking the main thread
📈 Performance Impact Summary
Critical: 97.7% of load time is from API + JSON parsing
Minor: Only 2.3% from all other operations
User Experience: 5+ second load time is unacceptable (should be <1 second)
🔍 Specific Technical Issues Found
API Bottleneck: 3.5 seconds for profile data fetch
JSON Processing: 1.4 seconds to parse response
Duplicate Operations: Same data transformation running twice
Inefficient State Management: Multiple unnecessary state updates
Missing Optimization: No caching, lazy loading, or progressive loading
The primary bottleneck is definitely the slow API response time (3.5 seconds), followed by the unusually slow JSON parsing (1.4 seconds). These two issues account for 97.7% of your total page load time.
